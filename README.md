# Memory Game Project

a basic, fun game of a childhood classic, Memory!

## Background

This beginner project is a part of a student submission in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program. I converted provided files from a static project to an interactive game by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This game's responsiveness is written and intended to use only vanilla JavaScript.

To get started, open `index.html` to view the existing functionality.

## How to Play

The game is played by clicking the backs of the cards to flip them over, two at a time. The timer will begin once a card is clicked in the deck. When two cards match, they will remain shown. The objective is to find all 8 pairs as fast as possible! The game ends when all 8 pairs have been matched. Upon completion, a pop-up will appear to recording play time, the number of moves needed to find all matches, and the star rating. The lower the moves needed, the higher the star rating.

Keep playing, by clicking the replay button to beat your time!
