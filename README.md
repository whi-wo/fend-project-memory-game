# Memory Game Project

a basic, fun game of a childhood classic, Memory!

## Background

This beginner project is a part of a student submission in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program. I converted provided files from a static project to an interactive game by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

To get started, open `index.html` to check out the existing functionality.
